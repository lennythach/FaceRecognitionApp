### Description
- This is just a fun little project to apply my knowledge on machine learning.
- I trained thousands of augmented images of myself using OpenCV. 
- I used Kivy for our GUI. 
- FaceID uses the webcam to verifies faces and will know if that face is valid or invalid. (similar to faceid on the iphone)
- So if I try to verify face that is not mine it will be invalid. 
- This application can be scaled to allow other users to be verified.
